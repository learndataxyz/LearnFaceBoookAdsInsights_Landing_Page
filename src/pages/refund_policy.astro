            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 23 October 2025</p>

            <h4>1. Overview</h4>
            <p>
                At LearnFacebookAdsInsights, we strive to ensure our customers are completely satisfied with their purchase of the <em>LearnFacebookAds Insights</em> Google Sheets™ extension. This policy outlines the conditions under which refunds or returns may be granted, the process for requesting them, and our general principles for fairness and transparency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because our product is a <strong>digital software service</strong>, returns differ from those involving physical goods. However, we aim to maintain a customer-first approach while protecting against unauthorized use or abuse of our digital tools.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Eligibility for Refunds</h4>
            <p>Refunds are considered under the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> If you experience a persistent technical issue that prevents normal use of the product and our support team cannot resolve it within <strong>7 business days</strong> of notification.</li>
                <li><strong>Accidental Purchase:</strong> If you purchased the wrong plan or product by mistake and have <strong>not yet activated or used</strong> the extension.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Delivery:</strong> If, for any reason, you did not receive access to the product within <strong>48 hours</strong> of purchase, and our team fails to provide it upon notification.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Refunds <strong>will not</strong> be issued in the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You changed your mind after purchasing.</li>
                <li>You no longer need the product or your business circumstances have changed.</li>
                <li>You used the product extensively before requesting a refund.</li>
                <li>The issue is due to third-party account limitations (e.g., Facebook Ads API restrictions or Google Sheets™ access issues beyond our control).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Timeframe for Refund Requests</h4>
            <p>
                Refund requests must be made within <strong>14 days</strong> of the original purchase date. After this period, we cannot guarantee a refund.

            <p>
                Once a refund is issued, your license or access to the <em>LearnFacebookAds Insights</em> extension will be immediately revoked, and continued use will be unauthorized under our Terms of Service.
